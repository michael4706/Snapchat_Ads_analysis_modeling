# Snapchat_Ads_analysis_modeling
 
 This project is done with Ruoyu Liu
 
 This project is a Snapchat Political Ads exploration. We attempt to answer the question: What are the characteristics that will lead to higher impressions per spend?

The notebook includes:
1. Data cleaning and data visualization through different plots
2. Hypothesis/Permutation test on questions of interest
3. Evaluate the results from statistical testing and draw conclusion based on our analysis
4. Develop classification models for identifying Ads with high impressions per spend and low impression per spend.
5. Perform feature extraction and data preprocessing, and use grid search to obtain the best parameters for classification model.
6. Evaluate the performance of the model by calculating accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and False Discovery Rate(FDR)
7. Visualize the distribution of False Positive(FP), True Positive(TP), False Negative(FN), True Negative(TN) generated by the model to identify its bias.

Result:
Achieves Recall, Precision, and F1 scores of 0.72, 0.81, and 0.83 respectively.
